This error occurs when using AsyncStorage in Expo and involves a race condition where the app attempts to access AsyncStorage before it's fully initialized. This typically happens during the initial app load, leading to unpredictable behavior or crashes.  The error message might not be very descriptive, often manifesting as silent failures or unexpected data.
