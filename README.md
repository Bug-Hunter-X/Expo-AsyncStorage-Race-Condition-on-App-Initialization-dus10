# Expo AsyncStorage Race Condition

This repository demonstrates a common, yet difficult-to-debug issue in Expo applications involving AsyncStorage. The problem arises from a race condition where the app attempts to access AsyncStorage before it's fully initialized, usually during the initial app load.

## Problem
The core issue lies in accessing AsyncStorage too early in the app's lifecycle.  This leads to unpredictable behavior, including:

* Silent failures: Data might not be stored or retrieved correctly.
* Unexpected crashes: The app might terminate unexpectedly without a clear error message.
* Inconsistent data: Data might be partially written or overwritten.

## Solution
The solution involves ensuring AsyncStorage is ready before attempting any operations.  This is typically achieved using the `AsyncStorage.ready` method, which returns a promise that resolves once AsyncStorage is initialized.
